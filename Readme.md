# Nature of code

This repo contains my learning path through the book [The nature of code](https://nature-of-code-2nd-edition.netlify.app/) by Daniel Shiffman.

You can find notes about it on my docs site, but these are just 
a personal tool to remember things and to have a quick reference. 
For a deeper understanding it's better to go to the book.

The main objective is to complete a simulated ecosystem in P5JS.
