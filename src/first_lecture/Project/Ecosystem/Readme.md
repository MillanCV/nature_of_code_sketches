Step 1 Exercise:

Develop a set of rules for simulating the real-world behavior of a creature,
such as a nervous fly, swimming fish, hopping bunny, slithering snake, and so
on. Can you control the objectâ€™s motion by only manipulating the acceleration
vector? Try to give the creature a personality through its behavior (rather than
through its visual design, although that is, of course, worth exploring as
well).

Here's an illustration to help you generate ideas about how to build an
ecosystem based on the topics covered in this book. Watch how the illustration
evolves as new concepts and techniques are introduced with each subsequent
chapter. The goal of this book is to demonstrate algorithms and behaviors, so my
examples will almost always only include a single primitive shape, such as a
circle. However, I fully expect that there are creative sparks within you, and
encourage you to challenge yourself with the designs of the elements you draw on
the canvas. If drawing with code is new to you, the book's illustrator, Zannah
Marsh, has written a helpful guide that you can find in [TBD].
